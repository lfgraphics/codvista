                "Test early and test often" - advice from OWASP. Businesses
                across all industries should adhere to this advice from the Open
                Web Application Security Project (OWASP) regarding software
                security testing.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                This advice underscores the importance of integrating web app
                testing throughout the software development lifecycle. By
                testing early and frequently, developers and security teams can
                identify and address security vulnerabilities and issues as they
                arise rather than waiting until the end of the development
                process.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                The idea behind this advice is to catch and remediate security
                flaws as soon as possible, reducing the cost and effort required
                to fix them later in the development cycle. It also helps ensure
                that security is not just an afterthought but an integral part
                of the development process. Some industries, such as e-commerce,
                banking & finance, make security testing mandatory. Businesses
                in these industries must perform regular tests to comply with
                laws and regulations and protect user information.

                  The earlier you test web application security during the
                  development lifecycle, the better your chances of detecting
                  vulnerabilities. Include security to minimize risks and the
                  cost of remediation further down the line.
